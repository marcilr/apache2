How do I get Apache to follow symlinks?

There are two things here:
=========================
1. symlinks
2. directory listing


symlinks
--------
Assuming /var/www is your DocumentRoot for your default virtual host,
you should find your default virtual host configuration file (probably
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default) and put it inside that virtual
host block, e.g.

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

    DocumentRoot /var/www
    <Directory />
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
    </Directory>

If you haven't changed anything, that option should already be there.


directory listing
-----------------
To make Apache list the files in a directory, you need to enable the
Indexes option too, e.g. change

    <Directory />
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
    </Directory>

in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default to:

    <Directory />
        Options FollowSymLinks Indexes
        AllowOverride None
    </Directory>

Or, perhaps a more secure way is to change it to:

    <Directory />
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride Indexes
    </Directory>

and put this in /home/user/mydir/.htaccess.

    Option Indexes

why .htaccess doesn't work

By default, putting Options <something> in an .htaccess file won't work
because of the other entry in your config file: AllowOverride None.

That's why we have to put AllowOverride Indexes there.

Example
=======
For the GCI covellite Debian jessie 8.7 amd64 workstation I wanted a
symlink from /usr/local/htdocs to git/htdocs/gci/htdocs/ checked out
on my usb key at:
  /media/marcilr/ext4/htdocs

1. Move /usr/local/htdocs to usb key:
$ cd /usr/local
$ cp -Rv htdocs/ /media/marcilr/ext4/
$ rm -rf htdocs

2. Create /usr/local/htdocs symlink:
$ cd /usr/local
$ ln -s /media/marcilr/ext4/htdocs/ .

3. Update httpd.conf configuration file:
$ cd /usr/local/httpd/conf/

httpd.conf:197
<Directory />
    AllowOverride none
    Require all denied
</Directory>

  to

<Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride none
    Require all denied
</Directory>

4. Restart apache:
# /etc/init.d/apache2 stop
# /etc/init.d/apache2 start


NOTE: Had to make sure the /media/marcilr/ext4/htdocs path had 755 privs
      such that that apache running as daemon:daemon could access it.
