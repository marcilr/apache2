scriptaliasmatch.txt
  ScriptAliasMatch

  For situations where you require additional flexibility,
  you can use the AliasMatch and ScriptAliasMatch directives
  to do powerful regular expression based matching and
  substitution.  For example,

    ScriptAliasMatch "^/~([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/cgi-bin/(.+)"   "/home/$1/cgi-bin/$2"

  will map a request to http://example.com/~user/cgi-bin/script.cgi
  to the path /home/user/cgi-bin/script.cgi and will treat the
  resulting file as a CGI script.
