Redirects


Temporary and Permanent


"Redirect Methods
=================

There are a few different kinds of URL redirects, each of
which mean something different to the client browser.

The two most common types are 302 temporary redirects, and 
301 permanent redirects.


Temporary Redirects
===================
Temporary redirects are useful if your web content for a
certain URL temporarily needs to be served out of a 
different location.

For example, if you are performing site maintenance, you
may wish to use a temporary redirect of all of the pages 
for your domain to an explanation page to inform your
visitors that you will be back shortly.

Temporary redirects inform that browser that the content
is temporarily located at a different location, but that
they should continue to attempt to access the original
URL.


Permanent Redirects
===================
Permanent redirects are useful when your content has
been moved to a new location forever.

This is useful for when you need to change domains or
when the URL needs to change for other reasons and the
old location will no longer be used.

This redirect informs the browser that it should no
longer request the old URL and should update its
information to point to the new URL."
