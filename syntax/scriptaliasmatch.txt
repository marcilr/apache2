ScriptAliasMatch


Alternatively, the Alias[7] directive will map any part of
the filesystem into the web space. For example, with

  Alias "/docs" "/var/web"

the URL http://www.example.com/docs/dir/file.html will be
served from /var/web/dir/file.html.  The ScriptAlias[8]     <===
directive works the same way, with the additional effect
that all content located at the target path is treated as
CGI scripts.

For situations where you require additional flexibility,
you can use the AliasMatch and ScriptAliasMatch directives
to do powerful regular expression based matching and
substitution.  For example,

  ScriptAliasMatch "^/~([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/cgi-bin/(.+)"   "/home/$1/cgi-bin/$2"

NOTE: Meaning of $2 above ???

will map a request to http://example.com/~user/cgi-bin/script.cgi
to the path /home/user/cgi-bin/script.cgi and will treat the
resulting file as a CGI script.
