Access control by host


If you wish to restrict access to portions of your site based on the
host address of your visitors, this is most easily done using
mod_authz_host.[1]

The Require provides a variety of different ways to allow or deny access to
resources. In conjunction with the RequireAll[2], RequireAny[3], and
RequireNone[4] directives, these requirements may be combined in arbitrarily
complex ways, to enforce whatever your access policy happens to be.

The Allow, Deny, and Order directives, provided by mod_access_compat, are
deprecated and will go away in a future version.  You should avoid using
them, and avoid outdated tutorials recommending their use.

The usage of these directives is:

  Require host address
  Require ip ip.address

In the first form, address is a fully qualified domain name (or a partial
domain name); you may provide multiple addresses or domain names, if
desired.

In the second form, ip.address is an IP address, a partial IP address,
a network/netmask pair, or a network/nnn CIDR specification.  Either
IPv4 or IPv6 addresses may be used.

See the mod_authz_host documentation[5] for further examples of this syntax.

Require ip
==========
The ip provider allows access to the server to be controlled
based on the IP address of the remote client.  When Require ip
ip-address is specified, then the request is allowed access if
the IP address matches.

A full IP address:

  Require ip 10.1.2.3
  Require ip 192.168.1.104 192.168.1.205
  An IP address of a host allowed access


A partial IP address:

  Require ip 10.1
  Require ip 10 172.20 192.168.2

The first 1 to 3 bytes of an IP address, for subnet restriction.

A network/netmask pair:

  Require ip 10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0

A network a.b.c.d, and a netmask w.x.y.z.  For more fine-grained
 subnet restriction.

A network/nnn CIDR specification:

  Require ip 10.1.0.0/16
