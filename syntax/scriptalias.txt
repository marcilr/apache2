ScriptAlias


The ScriptAlias directive tells Apache that a particular directory
is set aside for CGI programs. Apache will assume that every file
in this directory is a CGI program, and will attempt to execute it,
when that particular resource is requested by a client.

The ScriptAlias directive looks like:

  ScriptAlias "/cgi-bin/" "/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/"

The example shown is from your default httpd.conf configuration
file, if you installed Apache in the default location.  The
ScriptAlias directive is much like the Alias[2] directive, which
defines a URL prefix that is to mapped to a particular directory.
Alias and ScriptAlias are usually used for directories that are
outside of the DocumentRoot[3] directory.  The difference between
Alias and ScriptAlias is that ScriptAlias has the added meaning
that everything under that URL prefix will be considered a CGI
program.  So, the example above tells Apache that any request for
a resource beginning with /cgi-bin/ should be served from the
directory /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/, and should be treated as
a CGI program.

For example, if the URL http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test.pl
is requested, Apache will attempt to execute the file
/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/test.pl and return the output.  Of
course, the file will have to exist, and be executable, and
return output in a particular way, or Apache will return an
error message.
