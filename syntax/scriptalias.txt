ScriptAlias


At SOA OIT DNR mapping selenium/test directory using:
  ScriptAlias "/selenium/" "/var/www/html/intdev/projects/selenium/tests/"

Checking intdev:/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  Looks like ScriptAlias' definitions start at line 776

Updated with:
  # cp httpd.conf httpd.conf-PRIOR-20190814

# grep -ni cgi-bin httpd.conf
776:ScriptAlias /awstats/ "/usr/local/awstats/wwwroot/cgi-bin/"
859:ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/cgi-bin/"
862:# "/var/www/cgi-bin" should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
865:<Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin">
1127:#ErrorDocument 404 "/cgi-bin/missing_handler.pl"
# 

Original cgi-bin definition from
intdev:/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf:851
#
# ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts.
# ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that
# documents in the realname directory are treated as applications and
# run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the client.
# The same rules about trailing "/" apply to ScriptAlias directives as to
# Alias.
#
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/cgi-bin/"

#
# "/var/www/cgi-bin" should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.
#
<Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>



The ScriptAlias directive tells Apache that a particular directory
is set aside for CGI programs. Apache will assume that every file
in this directory is a CGI program, and will attempt to execute it,
when that particular resource is requested by a client.

The ScriptAlias directive looks like:

  ScriptAlias "/cgi-bin/" "/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/"

The example shown is from your default httpd.conf configuration
file, if you installed Apache in the default location.  The
ScriptAlias directive is much like the Alias[2] directive, which
defines a URL prefix that is to mapped to a particular directory.
Alias and ScriptAlias are usually used for directories that are
outside of the DocumentRoot[3] directory.  The difference between
Alias and ScriptAlias is that ScriptAlias has the added meaning
that everything under that URL prefix will be considered a CGI
program.  So, the example above tells Apache that any request for
a resource beginning with /cgi-bin/ should be served from the
directory /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/, and should be treated as
a CGI program.

For example, if the URL http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test.pl
is requested, Apache will attempt to execute the file
/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/test.pl and return the output.  Of
course, the file will have to exist, and be executable, and
return output in a particular way, or Apache will return an
error message.
