  Ouch looks like python 2.6 is not supported by latest pip:
    Python 2.6 isn't supported by newer versions of pip.
    See https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/.
    --Pip stop working after upgraded #6819
      https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6819

  Google:
    "revert to last verison of pip that works with python 2.6"

  Yields:
    Just follow the instructions here:
      https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip

    1. Securely download get-pip.py.
      https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

    2. In the directory you saved get-pip.py, run

      sudo python2.6 get-pip.py

    and you'll be all set.

    This will install pip for Python 2.6, and won't
    touch your version 2.7 installation.

Checking intdev:/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
  Looks like ScriptAlias' definitions start at line 776

Updated with:

# ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts.
# ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that
# documents in the realname directory are treated as applications and
# run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the client.
# The same rules about trailing "/" apply to ScriptAlias directives as to
# Alias.
#
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/cgi-bin/"

#
# "/var/www/cgi-bin" should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.

The ScriptAlias directive tells Apache that a particular directory
is set aside for CGI programs. Apache will assume that every file
in this directory is a CGI program, and will attempt to execute it,
when that particular resource is requested by a client.

The ScriptAlias directive looks like:

  ScriptAlias "/cgi-bin/" "/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/"

The example shown is from your default httpd.conf configuration
file, if you installed Apache in the default location.  The
ScriptAlias directive is much like the Alias[2] directive, which
defines a URL prefix that is to mapped to a particular directory.
Alias and ScriptAlias are usually used for directories that are
outside of the DocumentRoot[3] directory.  The difference between
Alias and ScriptAlias is that ScriptAlias has the added meaning
that everything under that URL prefix will be considered a CGI
program.  So, the example above tells Apache that any request for
a resource beginning with /cgi-bin/ should be served from the
directory /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/, and should be treated as
a CGI program.

For example, if the URL http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/test.pl
is requested, Apache will attempt to execute the file
/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/test.pl and return the output.  Of
course, the file will have to exist, and be executable, and
return output in a particular way, or Apache will return an
error message.
