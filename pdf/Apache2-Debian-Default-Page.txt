Apache2 Debian Default Page


It works!
=========
This is the default welcome page used to test the correct operation
of the Apache2 server after installation on Debian systems.  If you
can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed
at this site is working properly.  You should replace this file
(located at /var/www/html/index.html) before continuing to operate
your HTTP server.

If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this
page is about, this probably means that the site is currently
unavailable due to maintenance.  If the problem persists, please
contact the site's administrator.


Configuration Overview
======================
Debian's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
upstream default configuration, and split into several files
optimized for interaction with Debian tools.  The configuration
system is fully documented in /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz.
Refer to this for the full documentation.  Documentation for
the web server itself can be found by accessing the manual if
the apache2-doc package was installed on this server.

The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on
Debian systems is as follows:

/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
