apache2 - Apache HTTP Server


The default document root is:
   /var/www/html

To change the document root:
  You need to edit the site specific config file at this path
  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled

  the file you probably need to edit is 000-default.conf

  just change the DocumentRoot from /var/www/html to /var/www/YOUR_DIRECTORY
